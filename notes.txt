So we have a steering timer and on each timer interrupt we turn off one coil
and turn on another, is asked to reposition.

How fast the timer should be is determined by the properties of the stepper
motor.

If the last pulse is not complete, change only when done.
Perhaps disable the timer once reaching the target position?

Still, when a different position is specified, the pulse should be started
immediately. I.e. before the first tick.

It would be convenient to do all motor manipulation within the timer
interrupt handler.

Let's start with just always running the timer and checking if the target
position is different from the current position in the handler.

There's still the problem of the initial steering calibration.
